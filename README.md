# Code Refactoring: horiseon-mock-up

DU Boot Camp- Module 1 Challenge: HTML & CSS Code Refactor

---
## Description

This is a project with the purpose to refactor existing code for the Horiseon website to increase its accessibility. The main goal was to use agile project management and follow Scout's Code (leave code better than you found it) during the refactoring process. Existing code needed to be organized and condensed to be more efficient without changing the webpage's content, function, or appearence.

### Requirements
A summarized list of requirements derrived from acceptance criteria:

- HTML code includes semantic elements and has a logical structure.
- Accessible `alt` attributes in all of the `img` elements.
- All headings in sequential order.
- Descriptive webpage `title`.

Goals:

- HTML and CSS code be as condensed as possible.
- CSS follow sematic structure of HTML elements.
- Comments to enhance code formatting, organization, and readability.

### Skills Learned/ Improved

Here is a list of some skills I learned and/or improved throughout this project:

- Became more familiar with VS Code, Terminal, GitHub, and Chrome Dev Tools.
- Reading and understanding HTML and CSS code.
- Identifying areas to consolidate code (e.g. classes, selectors, etc.).
- Adding comments to help the refactoring process - especially when condensing code- in addition to providing more organization.

## Changes Made

A list of the major changes made while refactoring:

- Added descriptive `alt` attributes to all images.
- Created a descriptive title.
- Changed the `div` elements to semantic elements.
- Adjusted heading tags to follow importance logic.
- Added comments to CSS and HTML.
- Changed some HTML classes in order to reduce the number of different classes.
    - Condenced CSS by changing selectors to match the new classes and combining duplicate rule sets.
