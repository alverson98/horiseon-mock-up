# Code Refactoring: horiseon-mock-up

DU Boot Camp- Module 1 Challenge: HTML & CSS Code Refactor

## Description

This is a project with the purpose to refactor existing code for the Horiseon website to increase its accessibility. The main goal was to use agile project management and follow Scout's Code (leave code better than you found it) during the refactoring process. Existing code needed to be organized and condensed to be more efficient without changing the webpage's content, function, or appearence.
